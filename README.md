# AI Capability Signals Dashboard

A lightweight, browser-based, **aggregate dashboard** for examining patterns and trends in AI capability over time, grounded in the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework**.

The AI Capability Signals Dashboard supports **sense-making, reflection, and governance-aligned conversation** about how AI capability is developing across an organisation — without surveillance, benchmarking, or individual assessment.

It is designed to help teams **notice patterns**, **surface tensions**, and **ask better questions**, not to measure performance or enforce compliance.

This tool is part of the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Tools** suite.

## What this application is

The AI Capability Signals Dashboard helps individuals, teams, and organisations:

- observe **aggregate patterns** in AI capability across the six framework domains  
- explore **trends over time**, rather than one-off snapshots  
- surface **imbalances or tensions** (e.g. innovation accelerating faster than governance)  
- support **leadership, governance, and strategic discussions** without performance anxiety  
- turn AI-related data into **reflection and dialogue**, not action-by-default  
- document shared understanding for committees, workshops, and reviews  

The tool is **capability-led, reflective, and interpretive**.  
It is explicitly designed to support **professional judgement**, not replace it.

---

## What this application is not

This tool is **not**:

- a monitoring or surveillance system  
- a performance dashboard or KPI tracker  
- a benchmarking or maturity-scoring tool  
- a compliance or audit instrument  
- a risk register or legal assessment  
- an automated decision-making or recommendation system  

All outputs are **signals, patterns, and prompts for discussion** — not verdicts or decisions.

## The AI Capability domains

The dashboard is grounded in the six interdependent domains of the CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework:

### Awareness & Orientation  
Shared understanding, boundaries, risks, and realistic expectations of AI in context

### Human–AI Co-Agency  
Role clarity, partnership practices, human judgement in the loop, and responsible prompting

### Applied Practice & Innovation  
Practical use of AI in workflows, experimentation, iteration, and improvement of practice

### Ethics, Equity & Impact  
Fairness, inclusion, harm reduction, transparency, and downstream impact awareness

### Decision-Making & Governance  
Oversight, accountability, policy alignment, approvals, and decision hygiene

### Reflection, Learning & Renewal  
Review cycles, learning from experience, capability renewal, and institutional memory

These domains act as **lenses**, not checklists.

## How the tool works (user overview)

1. Enter basic context information (e.g. team, programme, or organisational unit; optional notes)  
2. Record **aggregate capability signals** across the six domains  
   - Signals may be derived from prior assessments, workshops, surveys, or agreed reflections  
   - No individual-level data is required or supported  
3. Optionally add **timepoints** to compare capability signals over time  
4. View the dashboard to explore:
   - domain-level patterns and trends  
   - emerging imbalances or tensions  
   - areas of acceleration, stagnation, or lag  
5. Use the built-in **reflective prompts** to support discussion, sense-making, and governance conversations  
6. Export or print summaries for committee papers, workshops, or documentation  

The tool is designed to be used **collectively and deliberatively**, not mechanically.

## Outputs

The AI Capability Signals Dashboard provides:

- aggregate domain profiles (no individual or unit drill-down)  
- trend visualisations over time  
- imbalance and tension indicators  
- explanatory “why this matters” context  
- structured discussion prompts for groups and committees  
- printable, shareable summaries for governance use  

---

## Typical use cases

- AI steering groups and working groups  
- Curriculum review and programme-level discussions  
- Research governance and ethics boards  
- Leadership workshops and away-days  
- Capability retrospectives and annual reviews  
- Cross-functional sense-making conversations  

The dashboard is especially effective in contexts where **trust, ethics, and accountability** matter.

---

## Data handling and privacy

- The application runs entirely client-side  
- No accounts, analytics, or tracking  
- No data is uploaded or transmitted  
- All inputs exist only within the user’s browser session  
- Clearing the browser resets the session  
- Suitable for static hosting (e.g. AWS S3)

The tool is explicitly designed to **avoid surveillance and performance monitoring**.

---

## How to run the application locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)  
- npm  

### Install and run

From the project root:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
